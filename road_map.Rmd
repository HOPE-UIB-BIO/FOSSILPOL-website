title: "Project roadmap"

The FOSSILPOL project is always envisioned as software, which should be updated. 

We know there are already functions and features we would like to implement in the future.

See the planned future updates in **[project roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/HOPE-UIB-BIO/projects/3)**

If there is a feature you would like to implement first check the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-issues/issues), look if someone already did not mention it, and upvote it if it is already there. If the feature is not there, you can write a new Issue (but check out the [guidance](https://hope-uib-bio.github.io/FOSSILPOL-website/contributing.html) for contribution to the project.

We would regularly update the list.
