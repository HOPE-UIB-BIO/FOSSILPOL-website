title: "Project future updates"
---

The FOSSILPOL project is envisioned as a software that will undergo updates for further improvement. 

We are aware of functions and features we would like to implement in the future.

See the planned future updates in **[project future updates](https://github.com/orgs/HOPE-UIB-BIO/projects/3)**

If there is a feature you would like to implement, please first check the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-issues/issues), 
and look if someone already suggested it and 'upvote' it if it is already there. 
If the feature is not there yet, please feel free to make a new Issue as a contribution to the project. Note: check out the [guidance](https://hope-uib-bio.github.io/FOSSILPOL-website/contributing.html) for guidelines on making contributions. 

We aim to regularly update the list.
