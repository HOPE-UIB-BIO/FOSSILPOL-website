title: "FOSSILPOL project"
---

This website presents all information needed about the FOSSILPOL workflow that aims to process and standardise global palaeoecological pollen data.

<br>

## Authors
The FOSSILPOL workflow has been developed during the ERC project called the “Humans on Planet Earth” (HOPE) team at the University of Bergen:

## Project sections

The project consists of several sections:

* **A guide to process and standardise global palaeoecological pollen datasets for large-scale synthesis** - A manuscript in review in Global Ecology and Biogeography

* **[FOSSILPOL workflow](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-workflow)** - A tool to process multiple fossil pollen sequences to create a comprehensive, standardised dataset compilation, ready for multi-sequence and multi-proxy analyses (coded in the R environment)

* **[R-Fossilpol package](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/R-Fossilpol-package)** - An R-package package developed specifically to provide tools for the FOSSILPOL workflow.

* **[Technical guide to FOSSILPOL: The workflow to process global palaeoecological pollen data](https://hope-uib-bio.github.io/FOSSILPOL-website/)** - A detailed technical information for users of FOSSILPOL. A static version is attached as Supplementary material to the manuscript in review and a live version published as website.

* **[Scandinavia example](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-example-Scandinavia)** - Example of the FOSSILPOL workflow applied to fossil pollen sequences in Scandinavia

* **[Issue tracker](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-issues)** - Specific GitHub repository to manage all Issues detected in the FOSSILPOL workflow

* **[Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/HOPE-UIB-BIO/projects/3/views/1)** - Planned future updates
