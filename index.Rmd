title: "FOSSILPOL project"
---

This websites should serve as additional source of information for FOSSILPOL: The workflow to process global palaeoecological pollen data.

<br>

## Authors
The FOSSILPOL workflow has been developed during the ERC project called the “Humans on Planet Earth” (HOPE) team at the University of Bergen:
Suzette G.A. Flantua, Ondrej Mottl, Vivian Felde, Kuber P. Bhatta, Alistair Seddon, John-Arvid Grytnes, Hilary Birks, H. John B. Birks

## Project sections

The project consist of several parts:

* **A guide to process and standardise global palaeoecological pollen datasets for large-scale synthesis** - A paper published in GEB (in submition)

* **[FOSSILPOL workflow](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-workflow)** - A tool to process multiple fossil pollen sequences to create a comprehensive, standardised dataset compilation, ready for multi-sequence and multi-proxy analyses (coded in the R environment)

* **[R-Fossilpol package](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/R-Fossilpol-package)** - A R-package package developed specifically to provide tools for FOSSILPOL workflow.

* **[Technical guide to FOSSILPOL: The workflow to process global palaeoecological pollen data](https://hope-uib-bio.github.io/FOSSILPOL-website/)** - A detailed technical information for users of FOSSILPOL. A static version attached as Supplementary with the paper, and a live version published as websites 

* **[Scandinavia example](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-example-Scandinavia)** - Example of the use for FOSSILPOL workflow for Scandinavia

* **[Issue tracker](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-issues)** - specific GitHub repository to manage all Issues from the whole project

* **[Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/HOPE-UIB-BIO/projects/3/views/1)** - the planned future updates
