::: {.column width="55%"}
## Summary

This website presents all information needed about the FOSSILPOL workflow that aims to process and standardise global palaeoecological pollen data.

### Authors

The FOSSILPOL workflow has been developed during the ERC project called the [*Humans on Planet Earth* (HOPE)](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/EECRG/107501/hope) team at the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en):

Suzette G.A. Flantua\*, Ondrej Mottl\*, Vivian Felde\*, Kuber P. Bhatta\*, Hilary Birks, John-Arvid Grytnes, Alistair Seddon, H. John B. Birks

\* shared first authors

[Ond≈ôej Mottl](https://ondrejmottl.github.io/) is the main maintainer of the FOSSILPOL project

## Project sections

The project consists of several sections:

* **[A guide to the processing and standardisation of global palaeoecological data for large-scale syntheses using fossil pollen](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13693)** - An open-access publication in *Global Ecology and Biogeography* (Flantua et al. 2023)

* **[FOSSILPOL workflow](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-workflow)** - A tool to process multiple fossil pollen records to create a comprehensive, standardised dataset compilation, ready for multi-record and multi-proxy analyses (coded in the R environment)

* **[{RFossilpol} package](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/R-Fossilpol-package)** - An R-package developed specifically to provide tools and functions for the FOSSILPOL workflow

* **[Website](https://hope-uib-bio.github.io/FOSSILPOL-website)** - A main hub of all information about the FOSSILPOL project, including a step-by-step guide for users of FOSSILPOL with a description of the most important functions and user criteria throughout the workflow

* **[Scandinavia example](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-example-Scandinavia)** - A case study example of the FOSSILPOL workflow being applied to fossil pollen records from northern Europe

* **[Issue tracker](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/FOSSILPOL-issues/issues)** - Specific GitHub repository to manage all Issues detected in the FOSSILPOL workflow

* **[Future updates](https://github.com/orgs/HOPE-UIB-BIO/projects/3/views/1)** - Overview of the future updates we plan to do on the FOSSILPOL workflow and R-package

## Website pages

* [General information](about.qmd) - Information about how to obtain, set up, and run the FOSSILPOL project

* [A step-by-step guide](step_by_step_guide.qmd) - Detailed information about individual steps of the data processing

* [Get in touch!](get_in_touch.qmd) - Information about the community, future updates, issue reporting, and potential collaboration

* [Resources](other_materials.qmd) - Additional materials related to the FOSSILPOL project.
